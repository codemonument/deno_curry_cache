# Deno "Curry Cache" Library

A deno library by @codemonument which allows currying of a function to cache it's result. 
Has an interface to allow providing your own store!

## TODOs 

=> Integrate new ES Decorators into the lib! (Avaliable when Typescript 5.0 hits deno!)
Allow functions & methods to be annotatet with @CurryCache() to be able to add caching functionality more easily!
